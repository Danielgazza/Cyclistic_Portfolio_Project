Recommendation from analysis

* Since customers(casual riders) are more on the weekend. I would recommend, Cyclistic promoting weekend activities as biking racing, exercise for members. 
* Promoting summer activities such as bike competition for members, during the summer period. 
* Discovered Gen Z and Minnellas (those born between 1975 and 2000) have more weekend hires than any other age group under the customer category. For optimum reach, the advertisement should be run on social media. 
* Stations with more customers hiring rate, I recommend should be the target.
